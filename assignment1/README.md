## Instructions

**Let's Do Some Makeup To Our Page**

* You will create the HTML page from scratch. The extra features you want to add are entirely up to you.
* Our site will consist of several pages. In other words, it will be possible to switch to another page by giving links in the menu section.
* The colors are completely up to your taste. But if you want some help with colors, Colorhunt is a great site for color palettes.
* You can write Inline and Internal CSS tags. Using external is entirely your choice.
* Don't forget the semicolons when writing CSS. I know you will forget, such things happen...
* You can use w3schools.com's CSS tutorial for a helpful resource on CSS, and Fatih HayrioÄŸlu's website for a Turkish resource.
* Be careful not to use repetitive structures. Or use the feature we use in repeating structures. (Hint: Using Inline(Tag Specific), Internal(Same File) and External(CSS File) CSS)
* For the fonts you use on your pages, you can use Google Fonts, which we mentioned in the videos before.
* You can use list-style-position: inside to center the points of lists on the home page.
